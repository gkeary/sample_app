You cannot specify the same gem twice with different version requirements. You specified: rspec-rails (= 2.6.1) and rspec-rails (>= 0)

modified Gemfile
did bundle install  (i think)
ran rspec spec/   and it failed saying:  
    you already specified rspec-core 2.7.0  or some-such 
    you can solve by running 'bundle exec'
  so i ran:
     bundle exec rspec spec/
  and rspec reported:  '5 examples, 0 failures, 3 pending...

  next i tried doing a 'bundle install 1st 
     and ran:  rspec spec/
       it still threw...
  so I have to use bundle exec rspec spec/
